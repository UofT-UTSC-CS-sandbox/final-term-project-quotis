## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

* When: July 23rd, 2024
* Where: Online on Zoom

## Process - Reflection

### Decisions that turned out well

1. **Using Jira Ticket Numbers for Better Management**:
   - This decision greatly enhanced our ability to track user stories and tasks. By incorporating Jira ticket numbers into our branch names and commit messages, we achieved better organization and traceability, which streamlined the review process and reduced confusion during merges.

2. **Enhanced Pair Programming Sessions**:
   - Improving our pair programming sessions ensured smoother integration of features. This decision fostered better collaboration, allowing team members to share knowledge and quickly resolve issues together, ultimately leading to more robust code.

3. **Prioritizing Critical Tasks**:
   - Focusing on critical tasks such as resolving bugs and managing merge conflicts early in the sprint helped maintain project momentum. By ensuring that essential features were completed first, we prevented potential delays and kept the project on track.

4. **Collaborative Task Allocation**:
   - Working together on tasks that required both service provider and client information enabled us to plan future features more effectively. This collaboration ensured a more cohesive development process and facilitated smoother integration of different parts of the application.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. **Not Considering Dependencies in Merge Requests**:
   - We encountered issues because we did not account for dependencies when pushing changes. This oversight caused difficulties during the merge process, suggesting that removing dependencies from merge/pull requests might have been a better strategy.

2. **Lack of Clear Code Comments**:
   - Insufficient commenting in our codebase made it harder for team members to understand and maintain the code. This led to potential issues and delays in our development process, highlighting the need for better documentation practices.

### Planned changes

1. **Implementing Clear Code Comments**:
   - To improve code readability and maintainability, we will emphasize adding clear comments throughout our codebase. This change will promote better documentation and knowledge sharing among team members.

2. **Breaking Down Tasks into Smaller Units**:
   - We plan to split larger tasks into smaller, manageable units. This approach will improve progress tracking, resource allocation, and collaboration efficiency, enhancing our overall project management.

## Product - Review

### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1. **Service Provider Dashboard**:
   - Implemented the feed/dashboard/home page for service providers, displaying posts relevant to their field (e.g., plumbing posts for plumbers). This feature enhances user engagement by providing personalized content.

2. **Service Provider Profile**:
   - Developed the profile page for service providers, including a verification section where they can submit necessary documents. This feature increases trust and credibility for service providers on the platform.

3. **Service Provider Inbox**:
   - Implemented the inbox/notification functionality for service providers. This feature ensures that service providers receive timely updates about job requests and other important notifications.

4. **Service Provider Current Jobs Page**:
   - Developed the current jobs page for service providers, allowing them to monitor job statuses and manage ongoing jobs effectively. This feature improves job management and tracking for service providers.

5. **Service Provider Quotes**:
   - Implemented the quote submission page for service providers, enabling them to send quotes to job requests. This feature facilitates better communication and transaction between service providers and clients.

### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

1. **Edit User Profile Feature**:
   - Planned to implement the Edit User Profile feature, but changes to the user database schema, such as adding first name and last name fields and encrypting passwords, complicated the merge process. This feature is still in progress.

2. **Querying and Filtering Service Providers**:
   - While we intended to implement querying and filtering for service providers on the Services page, we have only managed to split them into different sections accessed via buttons. Further refinement of this feature is needed.

## Meeting Highlights

1. **Improved Collaboration**:
   - Collaborative work on intertwined user stories has proven beneficial, indicating that future sprints should continue this approach to ensure cohesive feature development.

2. **Enhanced Task Prioritization**:
   - Prioritizing critical tasks such as bug fixes and conflict resolution early in the sprint has helped maintain project momentum, suggesting this should be a continued practice.

3. **Code Readability**:
   - Emphasizing code comments and breaking down tasks into smaller units are crucial changes for the next iteration. These adjustments will improve collaboration and efficiency.

4. **Feature Completeness**:
   - Ensuring that features are thoroughly planned and dependencies are accounted for will prevent future merge conflicts and streamline the development process.

This review highlights our successes and areas for improvement from Sprint 3, setting a clear direction for the next iteration.
