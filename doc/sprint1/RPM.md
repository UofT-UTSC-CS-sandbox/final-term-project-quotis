# Release Planning Meeting

The release planning meeting was held on June 4, 2024, in person where every member of the group was present.

## Release Goals

The main objective of this release is to implement the foundational features necessary for the Quotis platform. In this sprint, we aim to develop the login and registration functionality to allow users to create and access their accounts securely. Additionally, we will enable users to create posts, allowing them to describe the handyman services they need and upload relevant details. Another key feature for this release is the creation and editing of user profiles, which will allow users to provide accurate information about themselves, manage their contact details, and update their requirements. These features are crucial for establishing the basic user flow and ensuring that clients can start using the platform to find reliable handymen.

## Scope

Users should be able to log in or sign up to access the platform. Once logged in, they can access the dashboard where they can view relevant information. They should be able to manage their profiles to personalize their experience, including editing their profile to provide accurate information, such as contact details and home address. Users should be able to post job requests with detailed descriptions and specific requirements, and upload pictures related to the job. They should receive and compare quotes from multiple service providers, view the profiles of service providers, including ratings, reviews, and verification status, and accept quotes and confirm job details, such as price and timing. Once the job is completed, users should be able to mark the job as complete. They should also be able to leave ratings and reviews for service providers to help future clients make informed decisions. Additionally, users should be able to search for service providers by skills and filter based on location, ratings, and verification status.

Service providers should be able to log in or sign up to access the platform. Once logged in, they can access the dashboard where they can view relevant job requests. They should be able to manage their profiles to showcase their skills, experience, and certifications, including uploading examples of previous work and any relevant certifications. Service providers should be able to view job requests from clients and submit quotes for the jobs they are interested in. They should also be able to manage their job engagements, including accepting job offers, communicating with clients, and marking jobs as complete. Service providers should be able to receive ratings and reviews from clients to build their reputation on the platform and apply for profile verification to enhance their credibility and attract more clients.

By achieving these goals, Quotis aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that meets the needs of both clients and service providers, ensuring a high-quality and reliable service experience.
