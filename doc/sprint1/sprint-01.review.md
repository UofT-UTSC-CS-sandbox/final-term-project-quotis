## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: June 16th, 2024
 * Where: Online on Slack

## Process - Reflection

During our review meeting on June 16, 2024, we reflected on our iteration and the process we followed. Here are our observations:

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * Agile Development Methodology: Adopting an agile development methodology, specifically Scrum, proved to be successful. It allowed us to have regular sprint cycles, which ensured timely delivery and effective collaboration within the team. The use of Scrum artifacts like sprint backlog and daily stand-up meetings helped us stay organized and aligned with our goals.

 * Team Coding Sessions: Regular team coding sessions helped in solving merge conflicts and fostering ideas. These sessions allowed us to work together in person, discuss challenges, and find solutions collaboratively, ensuring that everyone’s code ran smoothly on their local devices. It also made sure everyone was on the same page, ensuring that we avoided conflict and got work done in a timely matter.
 * Collaborative Decision-Making and Pair Programming: Emphasizing collaborative decision-making and pair programming was a positive aspect of our process. We encouraged active participation from all team members, promoting a sense of ownership and accountability. This approach contributed to a healthy team dynamic and improved overall outcomes. Pair programming, in particular, helped us test code and ensure smooth functionality across devices.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Inadequate Time Allocation for Testing: We underestimated the time required for testing and quality assurance. As a result, we were unable to thoroughly test all the features within the given timeline. This led to some undetected issues and required additional bug fixing after the iteration. In future iterations, we need to allocate sufficient time for testing to ensure a higher level of software quality.
 * Lack of Proper Branching and Pull Request Guidelines: We didn’t adequately discuss or document the steps and guidelines for branching and pull requests. This caused different merge conflicts, which led to the need for re-cloning and merging branches like the dashboard and dashboard-fix branches. Proper documentation would have helped in preventing these conflicts.


#### Planned changes

 * Increased Testing Time: To address the issues faced with testing, we plan to allocate more time specifically for testing and quality assurance activities. By dedicating sufficient time to test our features thoroughly, we aim to reduce the number of post-iteration bug fixes and ensure a higher level of software stability.
 * Creating Develop and Feature Branches with Code Reviews: We plan to implement a more structured branching strategy by creating develop and feature branches. Along with this, we will introduce code reviews to validate the completeness and quality of the code before merging branches. This would help in preventing merge conflicts and other issues.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * User Dashboard: Developed the user dashboard where users can access their quotes, create a post, and view their current jobs/posts. The functionality is in place, though it could benefit from further styling. This was actually not part of the original iteration document, but as we faced issues with image upload for creating the post, we decided to implement the dashboard instead as a feature.
 * Create and Edit Profile: Completed the profile feature where users can edit their personal details like address and name.
 * Login/Registration: Successfully implemented the login and registration functionality, allowing users to create and access their accounts securely.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Create a Post Page: We were unable to complete the create a post page. We faced difficulties using AWS and integrating images with MongoDB. This task will be prioritized in the next iteration.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Enhancing User Experience: We need to focus on improving the overall user experience of our application. This involves refining the user interface and making navigation more intuitive. Enhancing interactive elements will ensure a more seamless user experience.
 * Effective Task Distribution: We recognized the need for better task distribution and workload balancing among team members. Conducting a skills and preferences assessment will help in aligning tasks with individual capabilities, improving productivity and satisfaction within the team.
 * Regular Progress Evaluation: Implementing regular progress evaluations within each sprint to monitor our progress effectively. These evaluations will help identify potential risks or delays early on and allow us to take necessary actions to mitigate them, ensuring timely delivery and avoiding last-minute surprises.
