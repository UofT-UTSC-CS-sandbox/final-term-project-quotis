## Iteration 01

* Start date: June 4, 2024
* End date: June 13, 2024

## Process

During our initial sprint planning meeting, we engaged in a range of diverse agendas and assigned tasks according to a well-defined development schedule. Ultimately, the team came together to thoroughly review the product backlog to discuss a figurative team goal. This collaborative effort enabled us to estimate the planning of our sprint 1 leading into the roles of team members, designated events, and artifact production.

#### Roles & responsibilities

To ensure effective collaboration within our team, we have assigned different roles to team members, each carrying specific responsibilities. During our initial sprint planning meeting, we decided to implement a variant of pair programming for each user story, involving two programmers working together. This collaboration extends to both front-end and back-end development, testing, and software implementation.

1. **Danish**: In charge of creating the login and registration from the user endpoint.
2. **Zuhair**: In charge of creating the user dashboard where users can access their quotes, create a post, and view their current jobs/posts.
3. **Ji**: In charge of making the create a post page and getting it to show up on the service provider page.
4. **Mustafa**: Currently working on the profile page for the user where they can edit their details like address and name, etc.
5. **Mealad**: Running the testing and also helping out anyone who needs help in particular, but especially for the create a post feature since that is the hardest feature. Additionally, Mealad was pair programming with the rest of the team to ensure smooth integration and implementation of features.

#### Events

* **Daily Standup Meetings**: Every weekday at 9 PM Eastern Time to check up on everyone.
* **Tuesday Workshop Meetings**: In-person meetings to discuss ideas and potentially merge our code. Also, a good place for team members to sort out any major difficulties/matters.
* **Thursday Coding Sessions**: In-person coding sessions that will take place in one of the Bladen Wing labs on campus where we all work together to code in person. The session aims to foster open discussions, encourage idea-sharing, facilitate collaboration to overcome obstacles and maximize productivity as a cohesive group.
* **Quick Weekly Sync Meetings**: Each team responsible for a specific area will have weekly sync meetings. These meetings will be conducted either online via Discord or in person, depending on the pair program's schedule. The purpose of these sync meetings is to enable developers to stay connected and collaborate on the development progress of their respective features.

#### Artifacts

* **Jira**: Used to keep track of sprint progress and who was working on what tasks.
* **Slack**: For stand-up meetings we tracked our progress after each meeting, getting to know if anyone needed help and where they were in the process of completing their feature/user story.
* **To-do Lists on Discord**: To prioritize tasks by discussing in meetings and keeping a small to-do list on our Discord to help prioritize things such as merge conflicts and urgent issues.
* **Task Assignment**: Mainly done in the planning meetings but we also tried to give each member a task suited to their strengths and capabilities using Jira to assign the feature/user story.

## Product

### Goals and tasks

One of our top priorities is to allow users to sign up and create an account on Quotis easily. Users should be able to register with a username and password and provide additional information such as email, resume, and school details. During our sprint, we aimed to implement a sign-up and dashboard feature to get the app's base done so we could easily navigate to other pages from there and work on those features in different development branches. This approach allows us to divide and conquer as a team effectively.

The main features we focused on are:
* **Login/Registration**: Develop the login and registration functionality to allow users to create and access their accounts securely.
* **User Dashboard**: Enable users to create posts, allowing them to describe the handyman services they need and upload relevant details.
* **Create and Edit Profile**: Create and edit user profiles, allowing users to provide accurate information about themselves, manage their contact details, and update their requirements.

### Artifacts

* **Mock-ups for User Interface (UI) Design**: Created using draw.io for the visual representation of the database schema and Figma for design mock-ups to visualize the UI flow. We also used Canva for logo creation.
* **Database Schema**: Designed using Figma to create a visual representation of the database schema for Quotis. This diagram facilitated the preparation and correctness of the database design.
* **API Documentation**: Documented API endpoints for login, registration, posting jobs, and profile management to ensure clear communication between the frontend and backend teams. Tools like Postman were used to provide thorough documentation for the Quotis backend API.
* **Contribution Instructions**: Provided guidelines for setting up the development environment, choosing branch names, tracking issues, and using the pull request system. This facilitated an organized and cooperative contribution workflow.
* **Expo Emulator**: Used on the web to demonstrate our running app and ensure seamless integration of all features.
